# FlexiGift - Arbitrum Ecosystem Project

## Problem (Good & Legit)

"Over 20% of gift cards go unused, wasting billions of dollars annually."

### Why this works:

* It's a real, documented consumer problem
* Happens due to:
  * Brand-locked cards
  * Expiry dates
  * Forgetting balances
* Judges like problems with clear financial waste

### Real-world example

* In the US alone, unused gift cards = billions of dollars in breakage
* People receive Amazon / store cards but don't shop there → money stuck

---

## ✅ Solution (Arbitrum Ecosystem)

"On-chain gift cards built with **Rust + Stylus** that lock funds and let recipients spend flexibly."

### Why Arbitrum + Stylus?

* **10x cheaper gas fees** than Ethereum L1
* **Stylus contracts** (Rust → WASM) = better performance & memory efficiency
* **Real-time analytics dashboard** for transparency
* Smart contracts:
  * Lock funds securely
  * Track balance transparently
  * Auto-refund unused money
* Flexible spending = less waste
* This is not forced Web3 — blockchain adds real value

### Arbitrum Hackathon Categories

This project targets **3 categories**:

1. ✅ **Stylus-based contracts and tools** - Core contracts in Rust
2. ✅ **Dashboards and developer tools** - Analytics dashboard
3. ✅ **Orbit chain experiments** (Optional) - Custom L3 deployment

# 👤 USER FLOW (Step-by-Step)

## 🎁 Flow 1: Gift Giver (Creates Gift Card)

1. User opens the web app
   → clicks **"Create Gift Card"**

2. Connects wallet (MetaMask to Arbitrum)

3. Enters:

   * Amount: `50 USDC`
   * Expiry / refund date: `30 days`
   * Allowed merchants: `Uber, Zomato, Amazon`
   * Optional message: *"Happy Birthday 🎉"*

4. Clicks **Create**

   * Transaction sent to Stylus contract
   * USDC locked in smart contract

✅ **Result:**
A digital gift card link is generated and shared with the recipient.

---

## 👤 Flow 2: Gift Receiver (Uses Gift Card)

1. Recipient opens the gift card link

2. Sees:

   * Gift amount: `50 USDC`
   * Remaining balance: `50 USDC`
   * Allowed merchants
   * Expiry countdown

3. Selects a merchant (e.g., Uber)

4. Spends `10 USDC`

   * Stylus contract releases funds
   * Balance updates automatically

✅ **Result:**
Remaining balance = `40 USDC`

---

## 🔁 Flow 3: Refund (Unused Balance)

1. Expiry date is reached
2. Contract checks remaining balance
3. Automatically allows refund
4. Gift giver claims unused amount

✅ **Result:**
Unused funds go back to the gift giver
→ **No money wasted**
